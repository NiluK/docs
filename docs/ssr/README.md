# Server-side rendering

ReactQL apps run on both a Node.js server, and in the browser.

This makes it trivial to write apps that render full HTML on the initial page load, with a browser bundle that can continue where the server finishes.

That means faster apps, better search engine indexing, and a better overall experience for your users.
