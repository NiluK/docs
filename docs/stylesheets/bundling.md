# Bundling styles

---
In development, your styles will be bundled with full source maps into the resulting Javascript that's generated by Webpack Dev Server. No external CSS file is created or called.

In production, code is extracted out into a final `style.[hash].css` file that is automatically minified and included in the first-page HTML via a `<link>` tag that's sent from the server-side.

Webpack will do the heavy lifting and match up your React names with the CSS localised styles, so it'll work exactly the same way as in development.

> You don't need to do anything for this to happen &mdash; ReactQL takes care of it for you.
