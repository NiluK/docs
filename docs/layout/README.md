# Project layout

This starter has been designed to provide you with the key skeletal pieces to get you going, and make it easier to layer in your own code.

## File structure

* **[Folders](folders.md)**. How ReactQL code is organised, per directory.
* **[Webpack](webpack.md)**. What each Webpack file does, and how to extend code.
* **[Root files](root.md)**. The configuration files you'll find at the root of a project.
