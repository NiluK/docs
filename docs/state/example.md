# An example: To-Do list

---
In the [ReactQL examples](https://github.com/reactql/examples) repo, there's a '[No GraphQL, Just Redux](https://github.com/reactql/examples/tree/master/no-graphql)' project that provides a full-blown example of implementing Redux.

You can clone this code, and run it locally.

For the rest of this section, I'm going to show you how to replicate this repo _without_ removing GraphQL, so you can use the two side-by-side.

I encourage you to review the [Redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/) too, to get familiar with how Redux works. Rather than repeating concepts, I'll leave that to the library's author to tackle and instead focus on code.
